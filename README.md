# haraka-plugin-spamassassin

This plugin implements the spamd protocol and will send messages to spamd for scoring.

## Configuration

```
cp node_modules/haraka-plugin-spamassassin/config/spamassassin.ini config/spamassassin.ini
$EDITOR config/spamassassin.ini
```

spamassassin.ini

- spamd_socket = \[host:port | /path/to/socket\] _optional_

  Default: localhost:783

  Host or path to socket where spamd is running.

- spamd_user = \[user\] _optional_

  Default: default

  Username to pass to spamd. This is useful when you are running
  spamd with virtual users.

  You can also pass this value in dynamically by setting:

  1. `connection.transaction.notes.spamd_user` in another plugin.

  2. The special username: _first-recipient_. The first envelope recipient
     will be used as the username.

  3. the special username _all-recipients_ may eventually be supported. See
     the get_spamd_username function in the plugin.

- max_size = N _optional_

  Default: 500000

  Maximum size of messages (in bytes) to send to spamd.
  Messages over this size will be skipped.

- reject_threshold = N _optional_

  Default: none (do not reject any mail)

  SpamAssassin score at which the mail should be rejected.

- relay_reject_threshold = N _optional_

  Default: none

  As above, except this threshold only applies to connections
  that are relays (e.g. AUTH) where connection.relaying = true.
  This is used to set a _lower_ thresold at which to reject mail
  from these hosts to prevent sending outbound spam.

  If this is not set, then the `reject_thresold` value is used.

- munge_subject_threshold = N _optional_

  Default: none (do not munge the subject)

  Score at which the subject should be munged (prefixed).

- subject_prefix = \[prefix\] _optional_

  Default: **_ SPAM _**

  Prefix to use when munging the subject.

- old_headers_action = \[rename | drop | keep\] _optional_

  Default: rename

  If old X-Spam-\* headers are in the email, what do we do with them?

  `rename` them to X-Old-Spam-\*.

  `drop` will delete them.

  `keep` will keep them (new X-Spam-\* headers appear lower down in
  the headers then).

- connect_timeout = N _optional_

  Default: 30

  Time in seconds to wait for a connection to spamd

- results_timeout = N _optional_

  Default: 300

  Time in seconds to wait for results from spamd

### [check]

The optional check section can allow skipping SpamAssassin check for remote connection
meeting following criteria.

- authenticated

  Default: true

  If true, messages from authenticated users will be scored.

- private_ip

  Default: true

  If true, messages from private IPs will be scored.

- local_ip

  Default: true

  If true, messages from localhost will be scored.

- relay

  Default: true

  If true, messages that are to be relayed will be scored.

### [defer]

The optional defer section can allow returning a DENYSOFT status back to the
client. Setting these to true will force the client to retry later in cases where
spamassassin is not responding properly. If set to false, then the errors
will be ignored and message processing will continue.

- error

  Default: false

  If true, return DENYSOFT on socket errors

- connect_timeout

  Default: false

  If true, return DENYSOFT on socket connection timeouts

- scan_timeout

  Default: false

  If true, return DENYSOFT on scan timeouts

## Extras

A SpamAssassin plugin can be found in the `contrib` directory.
The `Haraka.\[pm|cf\]` files should be placed in the SpamAssassin local
site rules directory (/etc/mail/spamassassin on Linux), spamd should be
restarted and the plugin will make spamd output the Haraka UUID as part
of its log output to aid debugging when searching the mail logs.

## Changes

This plugin now passes the X-Spam-\* headers generated by SA through
unaltered. You can control the presence and appearance of X-Spam-\*
headers by editing your SpamAssassin config.

The default headers added by SpamAssassin are:

    add_header all Checker-Version SpamAssassin _VERSION_ (_SUBVERSION_) on _HOSTNAME_
    add_header spam Flag _YESNOCAPS_
    add_header all Level _STARS(\*)_
    add_header all Status "_YESNO_, score=_SCORE_ required=_REQD_ tests=_TESTS_ autolearn=_AUTOLEARN_ version=_VERSION_"

Other headers options you might find interesting or useful are:

    add_header all DCC _DCCB_: _DCCR_
    add_header all Tests _TESTS_
